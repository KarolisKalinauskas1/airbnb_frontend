# Frontend Axios Interceptor Fix - May 23, 2025

## Issue Fixed

**Camping Spot Detail Redirect Issue for Non-Logged-in Users**

- **Problem**: Non-logged-in users were being redirected to the login page when trying to access camping spot detail pages despite previous fixes marking these pages as public.
- **Root Cause**: The axios interceptors were not properly identifying the camping spot detail endpoints as public routes and were enforcing authentication.
- **Impact**: Potential customers without accounts couldn't view camping spot details, hurting conversion rates and user experience.

## Technical Solution

The issue was found in two components of the frontend:

1. **Axios Request Interceptor**:
   The axios request interceptor wasn't correctly identifying specific camping spot detail routes as public:

```javascript
// Old code - couldn't handle specific camping spot detail routes
const isPublicRoute = config.method.toLowerCase() === 'get' && (
  config.url.includes('/api/camping-spots') || 
  // ...other public routes
);
```

2. **Axios Response Interceptor**:
   The response interceptor was redirecting to login on all 401 errors, even for public routes:

```javascript
// Old code - always redirected on 401, even for public routes
if (error.response?.status === 401) {
  const authStore = useAuthStore();
  await authStore.clearSession();
  window.location.href = '/auth';
}
```

3. **Router Navigation Guard**:
   The router guard wasn't explicitly checking for camping spot detail pages in the navigation guard:

```javascript
// Old code - didn't explicitly include isCamperDetailPage in isPublicPath check
const isPublicPath = publicPaths.some(publicPath => 
  to.path === publicPath || to.path.startsWith(publicPath + '/')
) || to.path.startsWith('/camping-spots/') || to.path.includes('/api/reviews/stats/');
```

### Fixes Implemented:

1. **Added specific regex matching for camping spot details in axios interceptor**:
```javascript
// New code - specifically identifies camping spot detail endpoints
config.url.match(/\/api\/camping-spots\/\d+$/) || // Match specific camping spot by ID
config.url.match(/\/api\/camper\/\d+$/) // Match specific camper by ID
```

2. **Added public route check in response interceptor**:
```javascript
// New code - only redirects for non-public routes
if (error.response?.status === 401 && !isPublicRequest) {
  const authStore = useAuthStore();
  await authStore.clearSession();
  window.location.href = '/auth';
}
```

3. **Updated router guard to properly handle camper detail paths**:
```javascript
// New code - explicitly includes isCamperDetailPage in the check
const isPublicPath = publicPaths.some(publicPath => 
  to.path === publicPath || to.path.startsWith(publicPath + '/')
) || to.path.startsWith('/camping-spots/') || to.path.includes('/api/reviews/stats/') || isCamperDetailPage;
```

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the frontend axios interceptor fix:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\kkaro\OneDrive - Thomas More\SecondYear2nd\Web Programming\airbnb_for_camping\airbnb_frontend"
.\deploy-axios-fix.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Build the frontend with the axios interceptor fixes
2. Use the main deployment script (`deploy-critical-fixes.ps1`) if available
3. Fall back to direct Vercel deployment if the main script is not found

## Testing

After deployment, verify the fix by testing:

1. **Direct URL Access**: Open an incognito window and navigate directly to a camping spot detail page (e.g., `/camper/28`). It should load without redirecting to login.

2. **API Calls**: The camping spot detail page should be able to fetch all required data (images, reviews, location details) without authentication redirects.

3. **Booking Process**: Clicking "Book Now" should still redirect to login for non-authenticated users.

## Related Changes

This fix builds upon previous fixes to public route handling:

1. Previous fixes in `router/index.js` to handle dynamic route segments
2. Addition of `meta: { public: true }` to the routes configuration
3. This axios interceptor fix for API endpoints

All these changes together provide a comprehensive solution for handling public access to camping spot details while maintaining appropriate authentication for booking and other protected actions.
