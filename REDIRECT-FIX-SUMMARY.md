# Camping Spot Details Redirect Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Overview
Non-logged-in users were being redirected to the login page when trying to access camping spot detail pages, despite previous fixes to make these pages public. This was happening due to authentication checks in the Axios interceptors causing API requests to redirect users.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Axios Request Interceptor**: Was not properly identifying individual camping spot detail endpoints as public routes
2. **Axios Response Interceptor**: Was redirecting all 401 errors to login, even for public routes
3. **Router Navigation Guard**: Wasn't explicitly including camping spot detail routes in the public path check

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Axios Request Interceptor Fix
Added specific regex patterns to identify individual camping spot details as public routes:
```javascript
config.url.match(/\/api\/camping-spots\/\d+$/) || // Match specific camping spot by ID
config.url.match(/\/api\/camper\/\d+$/) // Match specific camper by ID
```

### 2. Axios Response Interceptor Fix
Updated to only redirect for non-public routes when receiving 401 errors:
```javascript
if (error.response?.status === 401 && !isPublicRequest) {
  const authStore = useAuthStore();
  await authStore.clearSession();
  window.location.href = '/auth';
}
```

### 3. Router Navigation Guard Improvement
Updated the public path detection to explicitly include camping spot detail pages:
```javascript
const isPublicPath = publicPaths.some(publicPath => 
  to.path === publicPath || to.path.startsWith(publicPath + '/')
) || to.path.startsWith('/camping-spots/') || to.path.includes('/api/reviews/stats/') || isCamperDetailPage;
```

## Deployment
Created a dedicated deployment script (`deploy-axios-fix.ps1`) that:
1. Builds the frontend with the fixes
2. Uses the main deployment script if available
3. Falls back to direct Vercel deployment if needed

## Expected Results
- Non-logged-in users can view camping spot details without being redirected to login
- API requests for public information (images, reviews, etc.) work without authentication
- Booking actions still properly redirect to login for non-authenticated users

## Documentation
- Created `AXIOS-INTERCEPTOR-FIX.md` with detailed technical explanation
- Updated `ROUTER-FIX.md` to reference this latest fix
- Improved deployment instructions

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application to ensure the fix is working correctly
2. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for authentication and public route access
3. Review other areas of the application for similar issues
