# Enhanced Debugging for Redirect Issues - May 23, 2025

## Overview

We've added enhanced debugging to help diagnose the persistent redirect issues affecting non-logged-in users when viewing camping spot details. These changes add detailed logging throughout the authentication and API request flow to identify exactly where and why redirects are occurring.

## Debugging Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Axios Request Interceptor

- Added detailed console logging for all requests
- Added isPublicRoute flag in logs to verify route classification
- Added explicit request URL logging
- Improved conditional logic for auth redirects with better error messaging

### 2. Axios Response Interceptor

- Added comprehensive error logging for failed responses
- Added status code and response data details in logs
- Added explicit logging for redirect decisions (whether redirect was triggered or avoided)
- Improved handling of 401 errors on public routes

### 3. CampingSpotDetail Component

- Added detailed logging in loadSpotDetails function
- Added 'X-Public-Route' header to all public API requests
- Enhanced loadReviewStats function with better error handling and logging
- Added improved debugging in onMounted hook to track authentication state
- Enhanced checkAvailability function with detailed logging for each attempt

## Deployment

To deploy these debugging enhancements:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\kkaro\OneDrive - Thomas More\SecondYear2nd\Web Programming\airbnb_for_camping"
.\deploy-may-2025-debug.ps1
```

## How to Use the Debug Information

After deployment, access the camping spot detail page as a non-logged-in user and check the browser console for detailed logs. The logs will provide information about:

1. Which requests are being classified as public vs. private
2. Whether authentication redirects are being triggered and why
3. Detailed error information for any failed requests
4. Authentication state throughout the component lifecycle

Look specifically for:
- `[DEBUG]` prefixed messages which contain our enhanced debugging information
- Any 401 errors that show up in the network tab
- Logs showing `isPublicRoute` as `false` for requests that should be public

## Next Steps

After collecting debug information:

1. Identify specific requests that trigger unwanted redirects
2. Verify if the public route detection is working correctly
3. Check if the backend is correctly marking routes as public
4. Determine if any auth middleware is being incorrectly applied
