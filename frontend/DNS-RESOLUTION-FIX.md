# DNS Resolution and Connection Error Fix

This document describes the implementation of DNS resolution error handling and improved connection error handling in the application.

## Problem

Users were experiencing authentication failures with Supabase, showing errors like:

```
POST https://kyxmgifuawpoiocyuexh.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

This indicates DNS resolution issues preventing the browser from connecting to the Supabase authentication service.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

### 1. Enhanced Connection Error Detection

- Added DNS resolution pre-check in `supabaseUtils.js`
- Added timeout handling to prevent indefinite hanging
- Improved error categorization (DNS_ERROR, NETWORK_ERROR, TIMEOUT_ERROR, etc.)

### 2. Dedicated Connection Error View

- Created `ConnectionErrorView.vue` to display user-friendly error messages
- Provides specific troubleshooting steps based on error type
- Allows users to run diagnostics and shows connection status

### 3. Router Integration

- Added `/connection-error` route to handle connection failure states
- Configured smart redirects from login page when network issues are detected

### 4. Network Diagnostic Utilities

- Implemented `networkDiagnostic.js` to provide comprehensive connection testing
- Tests browser online status, DNS resolution, and backend connectivity
- Provides recommendations based on diagnostic results

## Usage

When a network error occurs during authentication:

1. The application detects the error type (DNS, Timeout, etc.)
2. Redirects to the ConnectionErrorView with appropriate error context
3. Displays targeted troubleshooting steps for the specific error
4. Provides options to retry or run diagnostics

## Testing the Fix

You can test the connection error handling with:

```js
// In browser console
import { testSupabaseConnection } from './utils/supabaseUtils';
testSupabaseConnection().then(console.log);

// Or run the test script
node src/scripts/test-dns.js
```
