# Frontend Router Fix - May 2025

## Issue Fixed

**Camper Detail Page Redirection Problem**

- **Problem**: Non-logged-in users were being redirected to the login page when trying to view specific camping spot detail pages using direct URLs like `/camper/28`.
- **Root Cause**: The `renterGuard` function in the frontend router was not properly handling dynamic route paths containing IDs.
- **Impact**: This prevented potential customers from browsing camping spots without logging in, hurting conversion rates.

## Technical Solution

The issue was in the `renterGuard` function in `router/index.js`. The function was using a simple string-based check that couldn't properly handle dynamic route segments:

```javascript
// Old code - couldn't handle dynamic segments
const isPublicPath = publicPaths.some(publicPath => 
  to.path === publicPath || to.path.startsWith(publicPath + '/')
);
```

We fixed this by:

1. Adding specific checks for camper detail pages using both route names and regex patterns:

```javascript
// New code - specifically identifies detail pages with IDs
const isCamperDetailPage = to.name === 'camping-spot-detail' || 
                          to.name === 'CampingSpotDetail' ||
                          to.path.match(/^\/camper\/\d+/) || 
                          to.path.match(/^\/camping-spot\/\d+/);
```

2. Adding this check to the public path condition:

```javascript
if (isPublicPath || isCamperDetailPage) {
  console.log('Public path or camper detail page, allowing access:', to.path);
  next();
  return;
}
```

3. Adding debug logging to help identify future routing issues.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the frontend router fix:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\kkaro\OneDrive - Thomas More\SecondYear2nd\Web Programming\airbnb_for_camping\airbnb_frontend"
.\deploy-frontend-router-fix.ps1
```

## Testing

After deployment, verify the fix by testing:

1. **Direct URL Access**: Open an incognito window and navigate directly to a camping spot detail page (e.g., `/camper/28`). It should load without redirecting to login.

2. **Navigation Flow**: As a non-logged-in user, navigate from home → campers list → specific camper detail. Each step should work without authentication.

3. **Login Redirect**: Only happens when clicking "Reserve now" to book a spot, not when just viewing details.

## Related Changes

This fix complements our previous work fixing the checkout endpoint and geocoding cache permissions:

1. Fixed field mapping in the `/api/checkout/create-session` endpoint
2. Fixed geocoding cache to use writable locations on Railway
3. Fixed this router guard issue for seamless browsing experience
4. Fixed Axios interceptors for API requests (May 23, 2025) - see `AXIOS-INTERCEPTOR-FIX.md`

All these changes together ensure a smooth user experience from browsing through booking.
